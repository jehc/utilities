        <briefdescription>
	RobotVision is a library for techniques used on the intersection of robotics and vision.
	The main focus is visual monocular SLAM. It is written in C++ -- partially using object-oriented and  
               template meta programming. Thus, most techniques can be easily adapted to other 
               applications - e.g. range-and-bearing SLAM.

        <description>
	Update: RobotVision (1.1) is out. Among other improvements, the bundle adjustment implementation is much faster now.

	RobotVision is a library for techniques used on the intersection of robotics and vision.
              The current version (1.1) comprises bundle adjustment, feature initialisation 
               pose-graph optimisation, and 2D/3D visualisation among other things.             

              The bundle adjustment class follows the classical approach - the first order sparseness
              structure is exploited using the Schur complement. However, compared to other
              straight-forward implementations, it has the following features: The second-order 
              sparseness structure -- not all landmarks are visible in all frames - is exploited using 
              sparse Cholesky factorisation (using the CSparse library). Optionally, the implementation
              supports the use of robust kernels in order to guard against spurious matches. 
              Also, the implementation generalises over different transformations, landmarks and 
	      observations using template meta programming.
              Among others, SE3 pose transformation with 3D Euclidean points and 2D image observations are provided as
              a default implementation for monocular SLAM. Furthermore, the bundle adjustment class
              also contains an information filter for inverse depth feature points which can be used 
              efficiently for feature initialisation within a keyframe-based monocular SLAM framework.

              The pose-graph optimisation framework is using Levenberg-Marquardt,
              whereas the sparse Hessian is dealt with using sparse Cholesky factorisation
              (CSparse). Again, it generalises over different transformations. Apart from the
              standard rigid transformation SE3, it also supports 3D similarity transformations
              Sim3. In other words, it can also deal with scale drift which occurs in monocular SLAM.


                            
	       Both, the bundle adjustment class as well as the pose-graph optimisation class uses 
              Lie theory. Poses transformations (SE3, Sim3) are represented on a manifold/ as a Lie group
              while incremental updates are done in the tangent space around the identity/Lie algebra.
              In this way, we achieve a minimal representation during optimisation while ensuring that
              we are always far from singularities.

             2D and 3D visualisation classes are convenient C++ wrappers around OpenGL.
